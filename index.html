          <h2 style="color:black;">What is Climate Change?</h2>
          <p>
            &emsp;Climate change is a process in which the earth's climate changes over time.
            It is a relative natural process which earth has experienced over many years.
            The problem we face today is the rapid increase in climate change from our consumption of fossil fuels.
            Most of these problems have been a result of the industrial revolution and change in our energy consumption.
            By releasing so many greenhouse gasses in such a short amount of time there is
            much evidence to suggest that this has contributed to an increase of global temperature.
            The effects of this can be seen with receding glaciers, rising sea levels, ocean acidity, dangerous
            air pollution, and loss of many different kinds of animals.
            <br>
            <br>
            &ensp;The future remains bleak as the whole world continues to struggle for solutions to our many problems.
            Today's world and infrastructure depend on these fossil fuels, from boats to trains
            to cars that we use each day. To suddenly change fuels would require new infrastructure, new laws, new regulations,
            new vehicles, and new ways to live our lives. These changes would also come with a new price tag.
            Many governments and organizations are already doing their best to improve current practices such as becoming
            carbon neutral, removing pollutants and running on renewable resources. Governments and organizations lack the funding
            and the support along with the slow legislation process to keep pace with the damage being done.
            When all of this it taken into account experts estimate little to no time is left to fix the
            the damage we've done.<br><br>

            &ensp;A way to help and better inform others about the situation, is to show them advantages of renewables
            resources. Renewable resources can provide clean and efficient energy, with no dangerous byproducts, 
            have no need for expensive fuel, and are sustainable.

        <h2 style="color:black;">History of Energy Storage</h2>
        <h3 style="color:black;">Since the dawn of civilizaiton</h3>
        <p>
          Energy storage has been around for as long as we know. People would store water 
            underground to keep it at constant temperature. The modern electirc battery was also a mistake.
            It was claimed to produce energy forever at super low voltages of course.
            Captering energy and storing it has also been very closely tied when researching 
            renewable resources. Energy storeage has evolved over the years to capture mlre energy 
            in the smallest area possible. The transporatation of energy is also vital now 
            for current technologies as electric cars are pushing the limits on distance. 
            Damns  for example store enegy by preventing water from slowing. This is also a type 
            of storage. Energy is all around us, without storage however our lives would obviously different.

      Energy Consuption
      </h2>
      <div class="card-body">
        <p class="card-body">
            &emsp;The United States consumption of energy is huge. About 3.9 x 10^12 kilowatt hours a year.
          The solar energy that covers the United States is many more times that. If we could 
          capture .16% of that energy we could cover our energy needs. While we are slowly changing our
          energy consuption, only about 10% is coming from renewable resources. Some of the problems
          we come across when using renewables is their availabilty. They aren't always dependable,
          such as for example, solar panels at night or wind mills on a not so windy day.
          Even geothermal energy production is not very dependable as the resource takes a very long
          time to replenish. These factors make fossil fuels important as they can easily be 
          transported and stored and used when needed. The problem with even this is the availabilty.
          Estimates show that the current rate fossil fuels are limited to a few decades.
          Depending on them could cause disaster when it comes to a sudden stop. Another major problem
          with fossil fuels is the horrible efficiency they have. Fossil fuels require a heat engine,
          and are very inefficient with most running at 30%. To put it into perspective, things like solar panels
          run at 18% but without any harmful waste heat and dangerous gasses. Dams on the other side
          can run at 90%. Coal power plants also require a massive heat sink to transfer waste heat.
          his usually requires plants to be built near water and use water to release heat. 
          Energy consuption with renewable resources can not only improve our enviernment but
          can also reduce wasted enregy.

                  Renewables are in demand but aren't dependable due to changing enviernments. 
                  Storing energy can fix that. When combined with energy renewables, 
                  energy storage systems can boost the availabily of energy and boost efficiency.
