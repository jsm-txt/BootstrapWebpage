                    Renewables are in demand but aren't dependable due to changing enviernments. 
                    Storing energy can fix that. When combined with energy renewables, 
                    energy storage systems can boost the availabily of energy and boost efficiency.

          <h2>What is Climate Change?</h2>
          <p>
            &emsp;Climate change is a process in which the earth's climate changes over time.
            It is a relative natural process which earth has experienced over many years.
            The problem we face today is the rapid increase in climate change from our consumption of fossil fuels.
            Most of these problems have been a result of the industrial revolution and change in our energy consumption.
            By releasing so many greenhouse gasses in such a short amount of time there is
            much evidence to suggest that this has contributed to an increase of global temperature.
            The effects of this can be seen with receding glaciers, rising sea levels, ocean acidity, dangerous
            air pollution, and loss of many different kinds of animals.
            <br>
            <br>
            &ensp;The future remains bleak as the whole world continues to struggle for solutions to our many problems.
            Today's world and infrastructure depend on these fossil fuels, from boats to trains
            to cars that we use each day. To suddenly change fuels would require new infrastructure, new laws, new regulations,
            new vehicles, and new ways to live our lives. These changes would also come with a new price tag.
            Many governments and organizations are already doing their best to improve current practices such as becoming
            carbon neutral, removing pollutants and running on renewable resources. Governments and organizations lack the funding
            and the support along with the slow legislation process to keep pace with the damage being done.
            When all of this it taken into account experts estimate little to no time is left to fix the
            the damage we've done.<br><br>

            &ensp;A way to help and better inform others about the situation, is to show them advantages of renewables
            resources. Renewable resources can provide clean and efficient energy, with no dangerous byproducts, 
            have no need for expensive fuel, and are sustainable.
